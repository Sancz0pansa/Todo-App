<h1>Todo App</h1>

In this project, you have the ability to add, remove, or modify your to-do items. Additionally, you can apply filters to display active or completed tasks. All changes made are automatically saved on the server. Begin managing your to-dos by adding new tasks, removing existing ones, or toggling their status. Enjoy the experience! 😁
